			<p style="font-weight: bold;">I am the Flag</p>
			<p style="font-style: italic;">by Ruth Apperson Rous</p>
			<p>I am the flag of the United States of America.</p>
			<p>I was born on June 14, 1777, in Philadelphia.</p>
			<p>There the Continental Congress adopted my stars and stripes as the national flag.</p>
			<p>My thirteen stripes alternating red and white, with a union of thirteen white stars in a field of blue, represented a new constellation, a new nation dedicated to the personal and religious liberty of mankind.</p>
			<p>Today fifty stars signal from my union, one for each of the fifty sovereign states in the greatest constitutional republic the world has ever known.</p>
			<p>My colors symbolize the patriotic ideals and spiritual qualities of the citizens of my country.</p>
			<p>My red stripes proclaim the fearless courage and integrity of American men and boys and the self-sacrifice and devotion of American mothers and daughters.</p>
			<p>My white stripes stand for liberty and equality for all.</p>
			<p>My blue is the blue of heaven, loyalty, and faith.</p>
			<p>I represent these eternal principles: liberty, justice, and humanity.</p>
			<p>I embody American freedom: freedom of speech, religion, assembly, the press, and the sanctity of the home.</p>
			<p>I typify that indomitable spirit of determination brought to my land by Christopher Columbus and by all my forefathers - the Pilgrims, Puritans, settlers at James town and Plymouth.</p>
			<p>I am as old as my nation.</p>
			<p>I am a living symbol of my nation's law: the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights.</p>
			<p>I voice Abraham Lincoln's philosophy: "A government of the people, by the people,for the people."</p>
			<p>I stand guard over my nation's schools, the seedbed of good citizenship and true patriotism.</p>
			<p>I am displayed in every schoolroom throughout my nation; every schoolyard has a flag pole for my display.</p>
			<p>Daily thousands upon thousands of boys and girls pledge their allegiance to me and my country.</p>
			<p>I have my own lawâ€”Public Law 829, "The Flag Code" - which definitely states my correct use and display for all occasions and situations.</p>
			<p>I have my special day, Flag Day. June 14 is set aside to honor my birth.</p>
			<p>Americans, I am the sacred emblem of your country. I symbolize your birthright, your heritage of liberty purchased with blood and sorrow.</p>
			<p>I am your title deed of freedom, which is yours to enjoy and hold in trust for posterity.</p>
			<p>If you fail to keep this sacred trust inviolate, if I am nullified and destroyed, you and your children will become slaves to dictators and despots.</p>
			<p>Eternal vigilance is your price of freedom.</p>
			<p>As you see me silhouetted against the peaceful skies of my country, remind yourself that I am the flag of your country, that I stand for what you are - no more, no less.</p>
			<p>Guard me well, lest your freedom perish from the earth.</p>
			<p>Dedicate your lives to those principles for which I stand: "One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."</p>
			<p>I was created in freedom. I made my first appearance in a battle for human liberty.</p>
			<p>God grant that I may spend eternity in my "land of the free and the home of the brave" and that I shall ever be known as "Old Glory," the flag of the United States of America.</p>
