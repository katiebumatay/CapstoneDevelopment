Dev1: stopped at bug of trying to get variables to stay on click, make it show/hide properly, and trying to get the variable classes not to pile up

Dev2: duplicated to Dev 3 right before trying to get rid of skrollr. Bugs from dev1 were all fixed and more variables like color and font were added.

Dev 3: got rid of scroll and implemented position: sticky in css for scrolling, which required making the section height longer so the position stuck for longer as well as giving the sticky elements some margins (top/bottom). Changed "phrase header" placeholder in variable state to the actual text of the phrase hovered over.

Dev4: delete scroll file. Cleaned up variable function syntax. Make separate variables for image width and height instead of just image size. Link image placement and size variables.
