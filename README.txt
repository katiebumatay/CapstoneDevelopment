Dev1: stopped at bug of trying to get variables to stay on click, make it show/hide properly, and trying to get the variable classes not to pile up

Dev2: duplicated to Dev 3 right before trying to get rid of skrollr. Bugs from dev1 were all fixed and more variables like color and font were added.

Dev 3: got rid of scroll and implemented position: sticky in css for scrolling, which required making the section height longer so the position stuck for longer as well as giving the sticky elements some margins (top/bottom). Changed "phrase header" placeholder in variable state to the actual text of the phrase hovered over.

Dev4: delete scroll file. Cleaned up variable function syntax. Make separate variables for image width and height instead of just image size. Link image placement and size variables. Ability to scroll through variable overlay when clicked.

Dev5: Change blur toggle. Cleaned up phrase groupings. Started to add line/rectangle dropdown div to each section heading. Rectangle expand when click heading, show explanation working for pledge. show about by clicking landing page title. ease into variable overlay. adjust size and placement option of phrase based on length/size.
