			<p style="font-weight: bold;">2018 'worst year for US school shootings'</p>
			<p>This year, 113 people have been killed or injured in school shootings in the United States.</p>
			<p>That's the sobering finding of a project to count the annual toll of gun attacks in schools.</p>
			<p>At the beginning of 2018, Education Week, a journal covering education in the US, began to track school shootings - and has since recorded 23 incidents where there were deaths or injuries.</p>
			<p>With many parts of the US having about 180 school days per year, it means, on average, a shooting once every eight school days.</p>
			<p>Another database recording school shootings says 2018 has had the highest number of incidents ever recorded, in figures going back to 1970.</p>
			<p>That database, from the US Center for Homeland Defense and Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), uses a different way of identifying gun incidents in school, and says this year there have been 94.</p>
