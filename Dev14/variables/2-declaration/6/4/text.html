			<p style="font-weight: bold;">The Immigrant American Dream</p>
			<p>For centuries, citizens of the world have arrived on American shores with little more than a suitcase and a dream of a better life. The promise of freedom and opportunity continues to lure foreigners to the United States, even though stories of hardship and isolation comprise the bulk of American immigrant literature. Having reached the promised land, immigrants find themselves faced with unimaginable obstacles. Even Americans who have had a chance to adapt and become "successful"—according to the traditional definition of material success as defined by the American dream—experience feelings of cultural isolation and otherness. Refugees, those who come to America seeking protection from war or political or religious persecution, face entirely different problems. Many of these people long for home and do not necessarily crave the rewards promised by the American dream. Despite the myriad reasons that brought them, American immigrants share a sense of isolation that, in some ways, defines their life experiences.</p>

			<p>The American dream continues to tempt world citizens with its promise of financial security and freedom, but many who arrive, sometimes risking their lives to get here, find the actuality rarely matches the dream. For most immigrants, legal or otherwise, if they are not working dangerous, low-paying jobs just to make ends meet, they are suffering from cultural detachment and isolation—sometimes both. Of course, there are exceptions, which accounts for the fact that the American immigrant population continues to grow.</p>
