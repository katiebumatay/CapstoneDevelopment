			<p style="font-weight: bold;">Social Media's Age Of Happiness</p>
			<p>We all do it, we all see it — Instagram feeds full of smiles and Facebook posts with our vacation photos and tweets about how great our new exercise regimen is going. We read about how so-and-so's daughter is graduating from Harvard with honors and how Mike lost 100 pounds in 6 months and we look at ourselves thinking, "well, what the hell am I doing that's worth sharing?" Odds are you aren't going to be Instagramming a picture of an empty desk at a job you were let go from, or a selfie sharing how disappointed you are that you gained 20 pounds. The reality is, we're going to be sharing pictures of our new car or our kids or our success because social media teaches us that sadness and failure are shameful. Social media teaches us that anybody who portrays a perfect life on the web must be leading one.</p>
			
			<p>Our generation faces a dilemma that is far-reaching and so utterly alarming that even being able to recognize it doesn't mean that we are immune to it. In the age of Instagram and Facebook and Tumblr and Twitter we are constantly fed people's "happiness," and naturally, we want to compete with them. Thus begins a cycle of taking a sexier selfie than Jessica just posted or buying a nicer car than Jim did because we want to feel better about ourselves.</p>

			<p>We are constantly fed illusions of happiness, so we are afraid to be sad. Happiness is the emotion that we are confronted with every time we unlock our phones or open our laptops, but we're struggling to feel it ourselves and we're ashamed of it. One of the biggest problems that we have as social media users is that we measure our own happiness in a way that is neither healthy nor valuable. We measure our happiness based on other people's portrayals of their own. We see all of these photos of people smiling and wonder why we can't feel that too and we think it's not normal. We forget that we have no idea what is behind that photo album or Facebook status. A six-figure salary does not equal happiness. The bottom line is, we can never know anybody else's "level" of happiness, so we cannot measure our own against it.</p>
