			<p style="font-weight: bold;">Domestic Violence & Firearms: Gaps in Federal Law Leave Abused Victims Vulnerable</p>
			<p>As described below, federal law prohibits abusers who have been convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors and abusers subject to certain domestic violence protective orders from purchasing or possessing guns. The federal laws intended to prevent access to firearms by domestic abusers have significant limitations, however, leading many states to adopt broader laws that address these problems. These dangerous gaps in federal law are listed below.</p>

			<p>The federal laws do not apply to many abusers who victimize non-spouse partners. Domestic violence affects people in family or intimate relationships that fall outside the protections of federal law. For example, dating partners are not within the federal prohibitions unless the partners have cohabitated as spouses or have a child in common. The risk of domestic violence being committed by a dating partner is well documented. In 2008, individuals killed by current dating partners made up almost half of all spouse and current dating partner homicides. A study of applicants for domestic violence restraining orders in Los Angeles found that the most common relationship between the victim and abuser was a dating relationship.</p>

			<p>The federal laws do not apply to abusers who victimize a family member other than a partner or child. The current federal prohibitions also do not address violence against family members other than a child or intimate partner. They therefore do not address violence against someone like an abused sibling or parent. According to data from the US Department of Justice, the proportion of family homicides that involve a murdered parent has been increasing, rising steadily from 9.7% of all family homicides in 1980 to 13% in 2008.</p>

			<p>The federal laws do not apply to convicted stalkers and others subject to a protective order. Similar loopholes in federal law allow access to guns by convicted stalkers and abusers subject to domestic violence protective orders that cover the period before a hearing (known as “ex parte” orders).</p>

			<p>The federal laws fail to require domestic abusers to surrender their firearms. Federal law does not require domestic abusers to turn in their firearms once they are convicted of a crime of domestic violence or become subject to a restraining order. As a result, abusers continue to commit crimes with guns they are prohibited from owning under federal law. In 2011, more than 50 people in Washington State were arrested on gun charges while subject to protective orders.</p>

			<p>The federal laws are weakened because not all states report all prohibited abusers. In order for background checks to prevent abusers from obtaining guns, states must report abusers who fall within prohibited categories to the proper databases. Identifying the abusers to be reported involves a series of complex legal issues that many states have not yet addressed. As a result, many states do not comprehensively enter domestic violence protective order and offender information into the proper databases.</p>

			<p>The federal laws are weakened by ineffectual federal background check laws. Federal law does not require a background check to be performed before every sale of a gun, including sales by unlicensed, private sellers. The private sale loophole enables many domestic abusers to illegally obtain the firearms they use against their victims.
