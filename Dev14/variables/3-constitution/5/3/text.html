			<p style="font-weight: bold;">Trump Declares National Emergency to Fund Border Wall</p>
			<p>President Donald Trump on Friday ended one bruising political fight and starting another explosive one, declaring a national emergency he said would allow him to divert federal funds to pay for a border wall Congress has refused to approve.</p>

			<p>"It's a great thing to do because we have an invasion" of drugs, human traffickers and criminals, Trump said during remarks that opened with an update on trade talks with China and meandered to include North Korea, the economy and other topics unrelated to the emergency he said the country faces. Democrats and border security experts have said drugs come through ports of entry and not open border areas, but Trump called that a "lie."</p>

			<p>The president said he expected to be sued – and to lose – until the case gets to the Supreme Court, where he said he hoped to get "a fair shake."</p>

			<p>Including the $1.38 billion Congress OK'd for 55 miles of border fencing, the administration expects to cobble together a total of $8 billion for a wall, more than the $5.7 billion Trump sought unsuccessfully from Congress. The cash would come from a military construction fund, the Treasury Forfeiture Fund – money the U.S. seized, such as drug-drug-related money – and the Defense Department's drug interdiction program.</p>

			<p>Trump, frustrated over Congress's refusal to fund a border wall he pledged during his campaign, had threatened throughout the process to invoke an emergency. Democrats pounced on the idea as an excess of executive power, but some Republicans – including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell – balked as well, saying they worried about the precedent it would set.</p>

			<p>But the Kentucky Republican changed his tune Friday, saying that after his conversations with the president urging him to sign the spending bill, he would now support the idea of an emergency declaration.</p>

			<p>The matter is certain to end up in the courts. Some foes argue that the idea is unconstitutional on its face; others worry that it will involve diverting money from popular projects Congress has approved – such as disaster funding for hurricane-ravaged areas.</p>

			<p>Senator Marco Rubio responded immediately to Friday's promise of an emergency declaration with a statement of opposition.</p>

			<p>"Today's national emergency is border security. But a future president may use this exact same tactic to impose the Green New Deal," the Florida Republican said. "I will wait to see what statutory or constitutional power the President relies on to justify such a declaration before making any definitive statement. But I am skeptical it will be something I can support."</p>

			<p>House Democrats have already pledged to offer a "disapproval resolution" slapping down the president. Such a resolution automatically goes to the Senate and does not require the usual majority-party approval to schedule a vote on it. With a number of Republicans skeptical of the emergency idea, such a measure could well pass – but Trump could veto it.</p>
