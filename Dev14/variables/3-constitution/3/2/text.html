			<p style="font-weight: bold;">Former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar sentenced to 40 to 175 years for sexual assault</p>
			
			<p>In a sexual abuse scandal that has reverberated across the American sports scene, former Olympic team doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced Wednesday to 40 to 175 years in prison for molesting young gymnasts and other athletes.</p>

			<p>The punishment was handed down in a Michigan courtroom where Judge Rosemarie Aquilina had spent days listening to impassioned, angry statements from about 150 women — including Olympic champions — who had been victimized by Nassar.</p>

			<p>“I’ve just signed your death warrant,” Aquilina told Nassar, noting that he would also be imprisoned 60 years for separate child pornography crimes.</p>

			<p>The 54-year-old sat with his head bowed during much of the morning’s proceedings, standing at one point to give a brief statement.</p>

			<p>“Your words these past several days,” he said, turning toward victims in the gallery, “have had a significant emotional effect on myself and have shaken me to my core.”</p>

			<p>For years, Nassar treated gymnasts and other athletes in an official capacity for USA Gymnastics, Michigan State University and a private gymnastics club. Victims have criticized those organizations and the U.S. Olympic Committee for ignoring initial complaints about him.</p>

			<p>Olympic gymnast Mc-Kayla Maroney has claimed the USOC covered up its knowledge of Nassar’s misconduct, stating in papers filed for a civil lawsuit in Los Angeles that officials established a “culture and atmosphere that conceals known and suspected sexual abusers.”</p>

			<p>Aquilina echoed such concerns, saying: “There has to be a massive investigation as to why there was inaction, why there was silence.”</p>

			<p>Within hours of the sentencing, the USOC announced that it would hire an independent third party to investigate when complaints were first brought and why Nassar’s actions went unaddressed for so long.</p>

			<p>The probe will include USA Gymnastics and its results will be made public, officials said.</p>

			<p>The Nassar scandal has drawn sports into a larger national debate over men, especially in politics and the entertainment industry, who have used their positions of authority to mistreat women.</p>

			<p>Angela Povilaitis, a Michigan assistant attorney general, asked the court: “What does it say about our society that victims of sexual abuse have to hide their pain for years when they did nothing wrong?”</p>

			<p>Nassar, who accepted a plea deal, has pleaded guilty to other counts in separate proceedings beyond the child pornography case. His accusers have said he molested them under the guise of conducting medical treatments.</p>

			<p>Athletes who came under his care — including such other Olympians as Simone Biles, Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas — were told that when he improperly touched and penetrated them, he was adhering to a proven method for addressing sports injuries.</p>

			<p>“The reality is, you caused me a great deal of physical, mental and emotional pain,” Raisman said to Nassar in court. “You never healed me.”</p>
