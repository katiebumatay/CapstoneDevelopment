			<p style="font-weight: bold;">The Scope of the Native American Genocide</p>
			<p>The size of the Native American population before the arrival of Christopher Columbus has long spurred debate, both because reliable data is extraordinarily hard to come by and because of underlying political motivations — that is, those who seek to diminish U.S. guilt for the Native American genocide often keep the pre-Columbus native population estimate as low as possible.</p>

			<p>Thus, estimates of the pre-Columbus populations vary wildly, with numbers ranging from approximately 1 million to approximately 18 million in North America alone — and as many as 112 million living in the Western Hemisphere in total.</p>

			<p>However large the original population was, by 1900 that number fell to its nadir of just 237,196 in the United States.</p>

			<p>Wars between tribes and settlers as well as the taking of native lands and other forms or oppression led to these large death tolls, with death rates for Native American populations as high as 95 percent in the wake of European colonialism.</p>

			<p>Nevertheless, the majority of Native American deaths stemmed from disease and malnutrition attendant on the spread of the European settlers, not warfare or direct assaults.</p>

			<p>Disease, the biggest culprit, wiped out an estimated 90 percent of the population.</p>

			<p>Native Americans were simply not immune to the Old World pathogens spread by the settlers and their domesticated cows, pigs, sheep, goats, and horses. As a result, millions of natives died from measles, influenza, whooping cough, diphtheria, typhus, bubonic plague, cholera, and scarlet fever.</p>
