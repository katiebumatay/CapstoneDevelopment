			<p style="font-style: italic;">Can the Question “Who Wrote the Constitution” Be Answered?</p>

			<p style="font-style: italic;">Who Wrote the Constitution: Alexander Hamilton</p>

			<p>James Madison is also credited with the conception of the Bill of Rights; due to his conveyance of the absence of a Constitutional Clause providing a system for both the amendment and adjustment of the original text, a clause was subsequently created rectifying these concerns – the actions of James Madison resulted in the proposal of the Bill of Rights in 1789, as well as its subsequent ratification in 1791</p>
