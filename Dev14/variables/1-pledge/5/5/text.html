			<p style="font-weight: bold;">Muslim Travel Ban: Less Immigration And Few Waivers</p>
			<p>During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” Not all Muslims were stopped from coming to America but an analysis of the Trump administration’s travel ban shows many fewer legal immigrants and temporary visa holders came to America in 2018 from the 5 majority-Muslim nations targeted by the ban. Moreover, new information obtained from the State Department reveals even fewer “waivers” from the travel ban have been granted than government statistics indicate.</p>

			<p>“The Supreme court upheld the Trump administration’s travel ban 5-4, affirming the president’s power over matters of national security,” reported Politico on June 26, 2018. “The latest iteration of the ban includes restrictions against five majority-Muslim nations – Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. North Korea and Venezuela are also on the list. . . . While the text of the order does not mention religion, critics say the policy reflects anti-Muslim prejudice – with North Korea and Venezuela added as window dressing.”</p>
