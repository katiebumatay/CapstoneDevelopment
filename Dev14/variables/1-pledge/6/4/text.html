			<p style="font-weight: bold;">#Calexit: Is it possible for California to secede from U.S.?</p>
			<p>After Donald Trump was elected as the 45th president of the United States, many Californians voiced their disapproval by calling for California to secede from the U.S.</p>

			<p>But can California actually secede from the United States?</p>

			<p>In 1961, McDonald County, Mo., briefly became McDonald Territory after attempting to secede from the state of Missouri. More recently, a movement in Texas called for a #Texit from the United States, and several northern California cities have proposed a State of Jefferson separated from California.</p>

			<p>In California, a political group dubbed the Yes California Independence Campaign is using the Trump win as an opportunity to breathe life into their crusade to make California an independent country. The group hopes to put a referendum on a 2018 ballot that will allow Californians to make the choice to #Calexit once and for all.</p>

			<p>But states hopes of succession are nothing more than California Dreamin', according to David A. Carrillo, Executive Director of the California Constitution Center at the University of California, Berkeley Law.</p>

			<p>"There is no legal basis for a state to secede from the union." Carrillo said. "The U.S. Constitution (A4s3) has a procedure for adding new states or subdividing existing states--both require Congress to consent. But there is no procedure, at all, in the U.S. constitution for a state to secede."</p>

			<p>California's own Constitution (A3s1) states that, "The State of California is an inseparable part of the United States of America, and the United States Constitution is the supreme law of the land."</p>

			<p>Carrillo also discussed the probability and previous outcomes from other states.</p>

			<p>"It's extremely unlikely California could secede, legally or otherwise." he said. "A group of states tried that once. It ended very badly for them."</p>
