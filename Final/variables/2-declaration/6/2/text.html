			<p style="font-weight: bold;">The real college crisis: Student debt drags down economy</p>
			<p>The college admissions scandal may have driven the conversation about higher education this week, but away from the headlines the far bigger story is student loan debt and what it is doing to a generation of Americans.</p>

			<p>For a large group of young people, many so-called millennials, the desire to attend the best possible school (and the desire for graduate degrees) combined with spiraling college costs may be fundamentally altering the economy — and the next era of American politics.</p>

			<p>Consider a recent analysis from staff at the Federal Reserve. It found that the average student loan debt held by those in the 24- to 32-year-old age group doubled from $5,000 to $10,000 between 2005 and 2014. And that same report found that home ownership fell 9 percentage points in that same time period for those in that age group.</p>

			<p>Homeownership fell across all age groups by about 4 percentage points, but the millennial drop was much steeper.</p>

			<p>You can see the impact of student loan debt on millennials when you compare their financial liabilities to other generations.</p>

			<p>On average, millennials, ages 18 to 34, carry about $36,000 in debt, according to a 2018 study by Northwestern Mutual Life. That looks very similar to the numbers for Generation X, who carry $39,000 in debt on average, and Baby Boomers who hold about $36,000 in debt, according to the study.</p>

			<p>But the numbers look very different in that study when you break it down into categories.</p>

			<p>The largest source of debt for Gen Xers and Baby Boomers is their mortgages, which clock in at 32 percent and 25 percent respectively for those age groups. The biggest source of debt for millennials? Personal education loans at 21 percent.</p>

			<p>Those numbers raise some serious issues. Millennials have almost the same amount of debt, in dollar terms, as their older generational counterparts, but their debt is primarily going to pay off something they have already acquired, their education.</p>

			<p>The net impact is not only a drag in their personal financial situation, but it’s also a drag on the economy as a whole. It means millions of young Americans have less money to spend on the goods and services — and particularly on big-ticket items like homes and cars that are the backbone of the economy.</p>
