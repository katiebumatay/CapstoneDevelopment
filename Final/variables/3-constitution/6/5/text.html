			<p style="font-weight: bold;">6 Quick ObamaCare Facts</p>
			<ol>
				<li>ObamaCare is a nickname for a healthcare law signed by President Obama in 2010 called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (or PPACA for short). It is sometimes also called the Affordable Care Act (ACA).</li><br>

				<li>ObamaCare expands health coverage. It does this by expanding Medicaid to single adults, expanding employer coverage, requiring insurers to cover preexisting conditions, offering cost assistance on plans sold on state and federal Health Insurance Marketplaces, letting young adults stay on their parents plan until 26, and more.</li><br>

				<li>ObamaCare improves the quality of coverage. For example, all major health plans must now offer 10 essential benefits including maternity care, lab services, and mental health services.</li><br>

				<li>ObamaCare creates an open enrollment period during which people can use federal and state marketplaces to shop for coverage with cost assistance. The official marketplace is HealthCare.Gov (but a marketplace approved broker can also help you shop for plans).</li><br>

				<li>ObamaCare’s cost assistance lowers premiums and/or out-of-pocket costs. Many single adults and families qualify for marketplace cost assistance or free or low cost coverage under Medicaid/CHIP based on factors like family size and income.</li><br>

				<li>Only plans that comply with ObamaCare’s rules qualify for cost assistance and offer all the benefits, rights, and protections ensured by the law. So, for example, short term health insurance doesn’t have to meet the same standards and doesn’t qualify for cost assistance.</li><br>
