			<p style="font-weight: bold;">Trail of Tears</p>
			<p>In 1838 Cherokee people were forcibly moved from their homeland and relocated to Indian Territory, now Oklahoma.  They resisted their Removal by creating their own newspaper, The Cherokee Phoenix, as a platform for their views.  They sent their educated young men on speaking tours throughout the United States.  They lobbied Congress, and created a petition with more than 15,000 Cherokee signatures against Removal.  They took their case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that they were a sovereign nation n Worcester vs. Georgia (1832).  President Andrew Jackson ignored the Supreme Court decision, enforced his Indian Removal Act of 1830, and pushed through the Treaty of New Echota.</p>
			<p>In 1838 Cherokee people were forcibly taken from their homes,  incarcerated in stockades, forced to walk more than a thousand miles, and removed to Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. More than 4,000 died and many are buried in unmarked graves along “The Trail Where They Cried.”</p>
