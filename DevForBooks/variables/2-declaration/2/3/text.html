			<p style="font-weight: bold;">Reminder: Today isn’t Equal Pay Day for all women</p>
			<p>This year, April 2 marks Equal Pay Day, the time a woman has to work into the new year to symbolically achieve the same pay a man earned the previous year.</p>

			<p>Working an additional four months to receive equal pay sounds absurd, but consider this reality: For African-American women, Equal Pay Day won’t be recognized until August 22. For Native American and Latina women, Equal Pay Day won’t be recognized until September 23 and November 20.</p>

			<p>Asian-American and Pacific Islander women reached Equal Pay Day on March 5, but massive pay gaps persist between subgroups. White women will wait a few days after April 2 for their Equal Pay Day to be recognized on April 19.</p>

			<p>Kim Churches, CEO of the American Association of University Women, says that Equal Pay Day is a date that has been marked by The National Committee on Pay Equity since 1996 and it marks the wages of all women working full-time to all men working full-time. The date, she says, is always on a Tuesday because that is approximately “how far into the week women work to catch up to men.”</p>

			<p>“The other Equal Pay Days are determined somewhat differently,” she tells CNBC Make It. “These dates compare the wages of all women working full-time who are of a particular race or ethnicity to all men working full-time who are white, non-Hispanic. Because non-Hispanic white men are the largest and most advantaged demographic group in the labor force, they are often used as a benchmark for the earnings of women of different races and ethnicities.”</p>

			<p>As it stands, black women earn $0.61 for every dollar earned by their white male counterparts. Native American women earn $0.58 to every dollar, and Latina women earn $0.53. Meanwhile, white women and Asian women earn $0.77 and $0.85, respectively.</p>
